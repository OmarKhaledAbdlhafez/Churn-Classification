## What is imbalanced data?
### Imbalanced data refers to those types of datasets where the target class has an uneven distribution of observations, where one class label has a very high number of observations and the other has a very low number of observations .
### lass imbalanced is generally normal in classification problems. But, in some cases, this imbalance is quite acute where the majority classâ€™s presence is much higher than the minority class.
### the main problem with imbalanced dataset prediction is how accurately are we actually predicting both majority and minority class , Sometimes when the records of a certain class are much more than the other class, our classifier may get biased towards the prediction .
